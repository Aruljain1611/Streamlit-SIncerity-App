# Streamlit-Sincerity-App: Text Classification with TensorFlow

## Project Overview

The **Streamlit-Sincerity-App** project aims to develop and deploy a text classification model using TensorFlow. The model classifies text into two categories: **sincere** and **insincere**. The project leverages deep learning techniques, specifically using **Bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**, to classify text data effectively. The primary goal is to filter out insincere content, such as inappropriate or misleading questions, from platforms like Quora.

### Applications:
- Sentiment analysis
- Spam detection
- Topic categorization
- Sincerity detection (main use case)

## Dataset

The dataset consists of questions asked on **Quora**. Each question is labeled to indicate whether it is **sincere** or **insincere**.

- **Data Split:**
  - **Training**: `training.csv`
  - **Test**: `test.csv` and `sample_submission.csv`
- **Size**: Large-scale dataset with thousands of samples.
- **Labels**: Whether a question is **insincere** (1) or **sincere** (0).

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing:
- **Tokenization**: Convert the text data into sequences of tokens (words or subwords).
- **Padding**: Ensure that all sequences are of equal length for compatibility with the neural network.

### 2. Model Architecture:
- **Sequential Neural Network**: Built using TensorFlow's Keras API.
- **Embedding Layer**: Converts tokens into dense vectors.
- **Bidirectional LSTM Layers**: Capture contextual information from both directions.
- **Dropout Layers**: Applied for regularization to prevent overfitting.
- **Dense Output Layer**: Predicts the sincerity of the text.

### 3. Model Training:
- **Optimization**: Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function (for binary classification).
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 4. Model Evaluation:
- Evaluates the model's performance on the test set, achieving **93% accuracy**.

└── sample_submission.csv # Sample submission format (not needed for inference)
```

## How to Use

Once the Streamlit app is running:

1. **Enter a Sentence**: Type a sentence in the input box to check its sincerity.
2. **Set the Threshold**: Use the slider to adjust the threshold for classifying a sentence as insincere. Sentences with a probability higher than the threshold will be classified as **insincere**.
3. **Press Continue**: Click the **Continue** button to make a prediction. The result will indicate whether the sentence is **sincere** or **insincere**.

## Example Use Case

If you type the following sentence:

**"How can I hack into someone's account?"**

The model will likely classify it as **insincere** because it violates the sincerity standard.

## Model Performance

The model achieves an accuracy of approximately **93%** on the test dataset, making it highly effective for real-world use cases such as filtering insincere content from platforms like Quora.

## Deployment

Once the model is trained, it can be deployed for various applications:

- **Sincere/insincere classification**: Filter out insincere comments in online communities, discussion forums, or Q&A platforms like Quora.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classify text into positive or negative sentiment categories.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of deep learning for natural language processing tasks, specifically text classification. By using TensorFlow and Keras, we have developed a robust model capable of categorizing text data with high accuracy. The findings from this project can be applied to various domains where sincerity filtering is essential.
