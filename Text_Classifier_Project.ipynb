The model will be designed to categorize text data into predefined classes based on its content. Text classification has a wide range of applications, including sentiment analysis, spam detection, topic categorization, and more.      \n","\n","\n","## **DataSet**\n","\n","The dataset used for this project comprises questions collected from various sources. Each question is labeled to indicate whether it was identified as insincere. The objective is to build a text classifier that can accurately predict the sincerity of the questions based on the provided labels. The dataset is already divided into training(training.csv) and test(test.csv and sample_submission.csv).\n","\n","**Key Details:**\n","- **Dataset Size**: Large-scale dataset with thousands of text samples.\n","- **Textual Data**: Questions asked on Quora.\n","- **Labels**: Whether it was insincere or not.\n","\n","### **Methodology**\n","\n","1. **Data Preprocessing**:\n","   - **Tokenization**: Convert text into sequences of tokens (words or subwords).\n","   - **Padding**: Ensures that all sequences are of equal length for model compatibility.\n","   \n","\n","2. **Model Building**:\n","   - **Architecture**: Develop a sequential neural network using TensorFlow’s Keras API.\n","     - **Embedding Layer**: Convert tokens into dense vectors.\n","     - **Bidirectional LSTM Layers**: Capture contextual information from both directions.\n","     - **Dropout Layers**: Apply regularization to prevent overfitting.\n","     - **Dense Output Layer**: Final classification layer for predicting text categories.\n","\n","3. **Model Training**:\n","   - **Optimization**: Compile the model with an appropriate optimizer and loss function (Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy for binary classification).\n","   - **Training Process**: Train the model on the training dataset.\n","\n","4. **Model Evaluation**:\n","   - **Metrics**: Model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure its performance.\n","\n","5. **Results**:\n","   - **Performance Summary**: Present the model’s accuracy on the test dataset is approximately 93%.\n","\n","6. **Deployment**:\n","   - **Integration**: The model can be used to filter out insincere comments on any platform with a comment option.\n","\n","### **Conclusion**\n","\n","This project aims to build a robust text classification model that can effectively categorize textual data into predefined classes. By leveraging TensorFlow’s deep learning capabilities, the project will deliver a model with high accuracy and generalization ability. The findings and results will provide valuable insights into text classification and demonstrate practical applications in various domains.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"23678c06-e8c1-4881-92dc-71c3cbdc08eb","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":178},"id":"23678c06-e8c1-4881-92dc-71c3cbdc08eb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1724442612163,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5653,"user":{"displayName":"ARUL JAIN","userId":"14886143103542526692"}},"outputId":"d2c6c77a-6df9-4862-cc99-15c7dc17a12a"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["target\n","0    140733\n","1      9267\n","Name: count, dtype: int64"],"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>count</th>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>target</th>\n","      <th></th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>140733</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>9267</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div><br><label><b>dtype:</b> int64</label>"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":1}],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","data = pd.read_csv(\"train.csv\") # Creating a dataframe out of the training data\n","new_data = data.iloc[:150000] # Reducing the number of rows to 1.5Lakhs\n","new_data[\"target\"].value_counts() # Displaying all possible values with their counts\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"edeedb08-436b-4a76-a3dd-47d6b74bcc19","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"edeedb08-436b-4a76-a3dd-47d6b74bcc19","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1724442612163,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":25,"user":{"displayName":"ARUL JAIN","userId":"14886143103542526692"}},"outputId":"7661a7b2-fae7-45ed-91e7-c6038647f154"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                    qid                                      question_text  \\\n","0  00002165364db923c7e6  How did Quebec nationalists see their province...   \n","1  000032939017120e6e44  Do you have an adopted dog, how would you enco...   \n","2  0000412ca6e4628ce2cf  Why does velocity affect time?
